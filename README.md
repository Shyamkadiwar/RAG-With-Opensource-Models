# RAG with Open Source Models

This project implements *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)* using open-source models from *Ollama. It utilizes **Llama-2* as the LLM and *nomic-embed-text* for generating embeddings. The system is enhanced with *LangChain* for better response accuracy and supports *PDF uploads*, allowing users to ask questions directly from documents.
